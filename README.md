# rep
Front-end Semantic Repository in Support of SIR, SEM, SVR and STD applications

# technical description

The HAScO API is a back-end infrastructure used to support the registration of scientific elements on the web. **rep** is a drupal front-end module that allows other Drupal-front end modules to connect to the HAsCO API. The **rep** module is thus responsible to know the IP of the back-end API as well as the security token in place for connecting to the API. Further, the **rep** module provides the user inteface required to manage the HAScO API knowledge graph. This means that the exact ontologies loaded and/or refered inside the API are decided through the use of the **rep** module.
